# PlayerEnviroment
PLE is a Pocketmine PHP5 Plugin, custom coded for use on FlintPE, that keeps track of player stats, creates a simple economy system and controls a player's enviroment (i.e. Hunger Management) to keep them safe in Non-Combat Zones. This plugin was created and tailored for FlintPE's custom needs &amp; wants, so it may not work on your server. Help is welcome, just make sure you know what you are doing!

WARNING: This plugin is also not in folder structure, as I am too lazy (and secretly don't want this used!).
